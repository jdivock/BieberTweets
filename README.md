Just learning meteor and making a POC

TODO:

Originally I did this just to learn meteor and figure out how to deploy to heroku and whatnot, but unfortunatley it looks like heroku doesn't support websockets and meteor really enjoys using websockets . . . so either I'll move this to EC2 or re-write it using angular and my own node server
